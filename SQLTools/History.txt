SQLTools++ Version 1.21RC3 (16-NOV-2008):
The following features tracked on Sourceforge.net have been added:
2094823   No connection to ASM instance possible
          You can connect now to an ASM instance. Although depending on your current settings you get various error messages
          the connection is no longer rejected but is successfully opened. The same should apply to RDBMS instances not opened. 
1992460   Add "Execute script from cursor position" option
          Two new options and keyboard shortcuts have been added to the "Script" menu:
          - Execute from cursor position (Default shortcut Ctrl+Alt+F5)
          - Execute from cursor position (Halt on errors) (Default shortcut Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F5)
          These can be used to run a script from the current cursor position and halt on errors, optionally
          Note that you need to add the following two lines to your "Custom" keymap ("custom.keymap" located in the "Data" subdirectory)
          if you're using it because the installer never attempts to modify the "Custom" keymap if updating an existing installation:
Script.ExecuteFromCursor      Ctrl+Alt+F5
Script.ExecuteFromCursorHaltOnErrors Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F5
1979440   Recognize DROP TYPE/CREATE TYPE operation
          The type related SQL commands are now recognized and confirmed with appropriate messages (Type created/dropped)
1919413   Add SQLTools++ on sourceforge link to menu/distribution
          The installation script now adds a link to the SQLTools++ Sourceforge.net site
1916777   (Optionally) do not populate Object List when connecting
          For users that have to connect using a low bandwidth (e.g. WAN) connection two enhancements have been added:
          1. If the schema browser is not visible it won't populate any lists initially (which was the case previously)
          2. You can disable the "Known object cache" feature in the "PlusPlus" settings which will prevent this in-memory
          cache from being populated when establishing a connection
1914736   Consider "Load DDL" shortcut (Ctrl+F12) in Object List
          This feature was already available with the "Development" intermediate build. You can press now the "Load DDL" keyboard
          shortcut in the "Object List" (Schema Browser). This is the same as performing a double-click or selecting "Load DDL"
          in the right-mouse button context menu
1914185   Allow "Copy Query Columns" for empty result set
          You can copy now the query columns even if the result set is empty

The following bugs tracked on Sourceforge.net have been fixed:
2270076   Snapshot DDL shows incomplete query for large query texts
          The built-in snapshot DDL generation code is quite basic anyway but additionally showed incomplete query text if the
          length of the query text was longer than 4000 chars. Now this has been extended to 64k which hopefully is sufficient
          for most complex queries
2166142   Known objects are not properly redrawn when settings change
          If you change settings and the "Known object cache" is enabled then the cache contents are refreshed every time
          you confirm the settings changes. This refresh was not properly reflected in the editor (Only when moving the cursor
          the content was redrawn). This has been fixed 
2062502   Change "Generic Exception" dialog to point to Sourceforge
          The "Generic" exception dialog now points to the SQLTools++ Sourceforge.net site and bug tracker rather than to the
          rather unmoderated original SQLTools forum 
2062499   Stack Overflow in Connect.cpp (429) when connection is lost
          When a background connection is established (e.g. with statistics or DBMS_XPLAN.DISPLAY_CURSOR enabled) and the connection
          is lost a nasty "Generic" exception used to show up. This has been fixed and should work now even with these features enabled  
2032463   Synonyms for remote objects are shown as "INVALID"
          Synonyms for remote database objects used to be shown with status "INVALID". This has been fixed
2032446   Known objects followed by a dblink - wrong highlighting
          If a known object was followed by a dblink the highlighting was incorrect. This has been fixed
2017327   Extract Schema DDL doesn't use "Use DBMS_METADATA" setting
          The "Extract Schema DDL" didn't use the "Use DBMS_METADATA" setting of the corresponding setup dialog. This has been fixed
1991909   Highlighting error in case of comment /* */ followed by *
          A minor highlighting error when a comment was immediately followed by an asterisk has been fixed
1988773   Incorrect representation of timestamp type in Object Viewer
          The TIMESTAMP family related data types were not correctly represented in the Object Viewer window. This has been fixed.
1988113   Run in external tool while disconnected
          You get now an appropriate message instead of an screwed up external tool call if you're currenly not connected to a 
          database 
1949675   Doing describe (F12) with lost connection raises exception
          Appropriate message shown instead of a "Generic" exception
1942383   "Use DBMS_METADATA" not saved in Settings dialog
          Handling of this setting is now similar to the other settings, it used to be inconsistent
1942045   Editor's backup file error
          If a backup file cannot be created the actual file save is no longer aborted and you should an explanation why the
          backup file could not be created
1941453   Opening *.txt files results in "Language 'NONE' not found"
          This annoying error has been fixed
1939328   Length of multibyte character columns incorrectly reported
          If you have multibyte character columns, e.g. NVARCHARs or multibyte database character sets (e.g. UTF8) then the byte
          size of the column was shown in the Object Viewer instead of the actual character size. This has been fixed
1939306   Extended Block information is wrong for lines with TABs
          TABs should be treated now correctly for the extended information shown when "Enhanced Visuals" is enabled
1939241   Visual match braces does not work with TAB chars
          TABs should be treated now correctly for the "match braces" functionality when "Enhanced Visuals" is enabled
1938706   Object List using list representation - quick filter applied
          The list representation mode was broken when a quick filter has been applied. The columns were resized to a minimum
          size so that the content was unreadable
1928265   Extract Schema DDL: "Type parsing error: invalid header!"
          Incomplete type definitions lead to this error message sometimes. The handling of these incomplete types has been 
          changed accordingly so that the message should no longer show up
1927183   DDL generated for deferrable disabled constraint is wrong
          The keywords for a deferrable disabled constraint used to be in the wrong order. This has been fixed
1927173   Table Transformation Helper wrong GRANTS with DBMS_METADATA
          When using the "DBMS_METADATA" package to generate the DDL the GRANTS generated were too many and about unrelated 
          tables. This has been fixed.

SQLTools++ Version 1.20RC3 (02-MAR-2008):

    - New major feature: Enhanced editor highlighting
      * Match braces
      * Highlight too long identifiers exceeding threshold length (default 30 chars but can be changed in "PlusPlus" settings)
      * Highlight known user objects for current connection
      * Show extended information about selected text in status bar
      Since this is quite beta, all the related new code paths can be disabled in the "PlusPlus" section of the settings
    - New feature: Auto resize columns after each fetch (analyses only the newly fetched array of rows)
    - New feature: Added external tool placeholder <SYS_PRIVS> which can be empty, " AS SYSOPER" or " AS SYSDBA" to support
      privileged connections in external tools
    - New feature: Order columns in Object Viewer for tables by column name, can be selected in PlusPlus Settings dialog
                   or toggled by using second keyboard shortcut (F12 / Shift+F12 by default)
    - Improvement: Reading NCLOBs is now supported, no longer ORA-24806 error message when attempting to fetch them
    - Improvement: Double-Click on column header border in Grid autofits column (similar to other windows lists)
    - Improvement: Appropriate message when not connected to database and attempting to expand a node in Object Viewer
    - Improvement: Use environment variable ORACLE_HOME if set in environment
    - Improvement: Use environment variable TNS_ADMIN if set in environment
    - Improvement: Support TNS entries having multiple aliases assigned delimited by comma
    - Improvement: Support both synonyms SNAPSHOT (LOG) and MATERIALIZED VIEW (LOG)
    - Improvement: Do not report ORA-28002 twice if using background connection for statistics or DBMS_XPLAN.DISPLAY_CURSOR
    - Improvement: More precise information about various data types in Object Viewer: NUMBER, FLOAT, *LOB
    - Improvement: Set filter to "N/A" if none of the QuickFilters "VALID/INVALID" are selected. This should filter on 
      objects like partitioned indexes that do not have a global status but an individual status for each partition object
    - Improvement: "Refresh All" in Object List now actually does a "refresh all" resp. marks all tabs for refresh the next time
      they are used (It didn't do it before, it just did a "refresh" of the current tab). 
      Note that this "Refresh All" also refreshes the "Known object" cache used by the enhanced editor highlighting, so in case 
      you've added/dropped objects you can use this option to refresh the cache used for highlighting
    - Improvement: All kinds of reverse indexes and function-based bitmap indexes are handled correctly
    - Improvement: Optionally disable cell selection wraparound in Grid
    - Change: No longer set focus to "Plan" pane when performing "Explain plan", use "Switch pane" (default: F6) to set focus 
      if needed
    - Change: Show execution times that are less than one second as milliseconds
    - Fix: Materialized view log handling (drop) fixed in Object List
    - Fix: Re-enabled "Allow remember manually changed column width" which was broken due to my misunderstanding
    - Fix: Get DBMS_METADATA DDL for MATERIALIZED VIEW LOG fixed
    - Fix: If unlimited DBMS_OUTPUT size is selected in settings, apply the changed setting to current connection
    - Fix: Consistent handling of statistics setting in current session if changing the setting in Settings dialog or in GUI 
      via button
    - Fix: 9i emulation of DBMS_XPLAN.DISPLAY_CURSOR now also enables the "Refresh" context menu entry
    - Fix: If "Connection lost" related error is thrown from remote do not close local connection
    - Fix: Exception no longer raised when clicking in the row header of an empty result set
    - Fix: Changing VALID/INVALID filters in Object List now invalidates all tabs so that changed filter is applied when 
      activated
    - Fix: Setting a filter in an Object list tab no longer invalidates all other tabs
    - Fix: Opening a non-existing document from the most recently used file list no longer raises an Exception
    - Fix: Re-enabled TAB key in Grid
    - Fix: "Find in Files" should work again. Correct "GREP.EXE" is now part of the installation package again
    - Documentation bug: 9i unfortunately does not populate the V$SQL_PLAN_STATISTICS_ALL view if statistics_level is set 
      to default value TYPICAL, therefore you don't get the basic plan info. You only get the view populated if statistics_level
      is set to ALL. Whereas 10g already mirrors basic plan information from V$SQL_PLAN into V$SQL_PLAN_STATISTICS_ALL in
      TYPICAL mode
    - Known Issue: The original SQLTools SQL execution mode does not work correctly. It sends only the current line to the 
      database rather than scanning for the end of the statement.Note: This has been addressed in the Development Build
    - Known Issue: Filenames after a SPOOL command in a SQL*Plus script are marked as invalid identifiers if exceeding the maximum 
      defined length. Note: This has been addressed in the Development Build
    - Known Issue: Auto resizing columns by doubleclicking on the header border does not work correctly when the first column is not 
      visible, which means that the grid has been scrolled to the right. It resizes the column to the left by the offset the grid has 
      been scrolled to the right.
    - Known Issue: Quoted identifiers (using "<IDENTIFIER>") potentially are not correctly recognized by new "Known objects" 
      hightlighting since the current tokenizer does treat them as "normal" identifiers and therefore breaks them apart in 
      case of any special character encountered 

SQLTools++ Version 1.10RC2 (22-DEC-2007):
(for detailed description see http://www.sqltools-plusplus.org:7676/sqltools_pp_110RC2.html)

    Improvements:
    - Tested with Oracle 11g Server and Client, recognizes 11g as server/client version
    - 11g session statistics supported
    - Filter header bars added to connection dialog and schema browser object list, similar to SQLTools 1.5
    - Freshened GUI look, the initial SQLTools++ release used accidentally the "old" Win9x style
    - Execute script and halt on errors (new toolbar button)
    - Execute script in external tool (new toolbar button)
    - Use optionally DBMS_METADATA to generate DDL (can be used from Server version 9i onwards)
    - Optionally save all files automatically before executing database operation
    - Test connection/Reconnect in case you were disconnected from the database, similar to TOAD functionality (new 
      toolbar button)
    - Schema browser object list supports now Snapshots, Snapshot logs and the Recyclebin in 10g onwards
    - Index as lookup object supported
    - DDL generation support for database and DDL triggers
    - Cleanup of Settings dialog: PlusPlus settings are now in a separate page grouped together
    - Copy selected entries from schema browser and object viewer separated by newlines using new 
      shortcut Ctrl+Alt+C in addition to the already supported Ctrl+C shortcut
    - Handle NULL passwords better by offering a separate dialog to enter the missing password
    - DBMS_OUTPUT now allows max. linesize of 32767 beginning with 10g
    - Unlimited DBMS_OUTPUT supported in 10g or later
    - 10g DBMS_XPLAN.DISPLAY_CURSOR emulation now available for Oracle9i, see "Data\display_cursor_9i.sql"
      You may change the contents of the file to meet your needs, or even save the code in a persistent
      procedure/package and change the file contents to just call this procedure/package.
      The file content is re-read each time the DISPLAY_CURSOR functionality is called
    - MERGE sql statement now recognized and appropriate feedback provided (no. of rows merged)
    - Popup Editor window can now be closed using the ESC key as shortcut
    - Handle Oracle error ORA-28002 ("password expires in next <x> days") more gracefully when opening a connection
    - Check for update on web site with a single click. Although not yet automated, you will be redirected
      to a web page using the default browser of your system that shows you if there is a newer version
      available for download.
    - Customizable settings regarding the "whitespace" and "blank" lines act as statement delimiter in the new
      "PlusPlus" settings page
    - Installation cleanup, default settings, files and web links updated

    Bugfixes:
    - Fixed issue with background session connection (timing issue while establishing the connection)
    - Explain plan did not adhere to "whitespace line" setting
    - Auto-fit columns is now executed even if the column descriptions stay the same (there was a caching
      active that compared the current columns of the result set with the previous and in case they were the 
      same no resizing took place. I deactivated that comparison because it annoyed me)
    - Object lookup in Object Viewer for similar object names used previous object in case previous object name 
      is superset (OBJECT_NAME1 vs. OBJECT_NAME) of current object name. Now an exact match is performed
    - Lookup of partitioned object fails due to unknown object type error message, this has been fixed

    Known Issues:
    - Believe it or not, but the DBMS_METADATA package sometimes generates invalid and incomplete DDL. For instance
      generating the indexes of an table having LOB columns by calling DBMS_METADATA.GET_DEPENDENT_DDL attempts to 
      create the LOB indexes explicitly using an incomplete and invalid CREATE INDEX command. 
      This holds true even for Oracle 11g, nevertheless I doubt that this is something you would dare to call 
      a "feature"... Still I render the option to use DBMS_METADATA as useful.

SQLTools++ Version 1.02RC1 (28-MAR-2007):

    Improvements (for detailed description see http://www.sqltools-plusplus.org:7676/sqltools_pp_102RC1.html):
    - Scan for beginning of SQL statement (empty line or additionally lines only consisting of whitesplace
      are considered as statement delimiters)
    - Scan for end of SQL statement, same as above. So you don't need to separate statements by semicolons,
      if you are lazy like me
    - Improved output in status bar when executing statements (separate information about execution and fetch
      time)
    - In Oracle9i and onwards use DBMS_XPLAN.DISPLAY to show execution plan. Old plan output is still available
    - Enable "Describe" in object list, so that an object is opened in the object viewer when pressing "F12" key
    - Pressing "Ctrl+C" in the object list and object viewer copies a comma separated list of the selected 
      objects into the clipboard
    - Drag&Drop in object list and object viewer supports multi-selection, double-click in object viewer
    - Support for cardinality feedback tuning using DBMS_XPLAN.DISPLAY_CURSOR output in 10g onwards
    - Background session support for session statistics and DISPLAY_CURSOR output
    - Improved session statistics (Auto detection, 9iR2, 10gR2 statistics sets)
    - Popup window for large grid cell contents supporting optional wordwrap
    - Reload NLS settings after executing "ALTER SESSION"

    Bugfixes:
    - Correct formatting of execution times greater than one minute
    - Various keybaord accelerator and handling issues improved
