<h4>Aleksey Kochetov Copyright &copy; 1997-2003</h4>
<p>SQLTools is a light weighted and robust tool for database development. It includes
  a text editor, an sql console and a couple of sql utilities. You can use it
  for dial-up connection and it will work as fast as SQLPlus. It is small and
  not required an installation so SQLTools will help you anywhere because it is
  small enough for floppy and available for downloading on the Web. <br>
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Powerful editor, which supports drag &amp; drop, syntax highlighting, code
    template expansion, etc. Context sensitive help provides information about
    the current sql statement. </li>

    information about database statistics and timing. </li>
