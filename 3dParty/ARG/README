arglib - readme

arglib is provided in a distribution tree that assumes the presence of 
GNU make and gcc. These are available for most platforms (see www.gnu.org).
For Windows these tools are supplied as part of Cygwin (www.cygnus.com).

The root directory contains the entry point of a global makefile.  If you 
wish to build the library using gcc you simply have to type:

    $make

For another compiler (e.g. Microsoft Visual C++) type:

    $make COMPILER=msc

The "platform" subdirectory contains the compiler specific options
(so hacking support for other compilers should be simple enough.)

Documentation may be generated using Doxygen by typing:

    $make manual

Doxygen is available from http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html
